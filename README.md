# Valerio Lyndon's Public List Designs for MyAnimeList

## Theme Info

Detailed information and install instructions can be found on [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=805506).

## Reporting Issues

The fastest way to contact me is through the [respective forum thread](https://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=805506) (preferred) or my [MAL profile](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Valerio_Lyndon). You can open an Issue here on GitHub, but I do not check here very often and may take a while to respond.

## Providing Feedback

If you have design or feature feedback about Clarity, 9anime, or Tilt, you should know these themes have been essentially feature-frozen. Due to how I had users install them (with auto-update functionality), I am hesitant to release anything beyond simple bug fixes. If you have feedback on any other theme, I will take it into consideration.

## Modifying Themes

Feel free to modify and use any of these themes however you wish to. My one request is that you do not claim credit for the original themes. I do not mind if you take snippets of code to create something new. Code being reused is commonplace; If the visible output is noticeably different, that's all that matters.
